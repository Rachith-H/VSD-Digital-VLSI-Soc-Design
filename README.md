- **Package:**
The physical casing that holds the silicon chip (die) and provides connections to the outside world. It protects the chip and allows it to be installed on a circuit board. Example: The black square or rectangle with metal pins you see on a PCB.

- **Chip:**
The complete electronic component that includes the silicon die, packaging, and connections. It is what we use in circuits, such as microcontrollers or processors.

- **Pad:**
A small metallic area on the die used to connect the internal circuits to the outside world through wires or bumps.

- **Core:**
A core is the fundamental processing unit within a chip that consists of the main hardware and executes instructions and performs computations.

- **Die:**
The small, thin piece of silicon inside the chip that contains the actual electronic circuits and components. It is where the transistors and other components are fabricated.

- **IP (Intellectual Property):**
Reusable design blocks or pre-designed functional units that can be integrated into a chip. Examples include designs for processors, memory controllers, or USB interfaces. Companies can license these IPs instead of designing them from scratch.

### 1.2 Introduction to RISC-V
---
To execute some C code on a hardware layout, the compiler first translates the high-level C code into a RISC-V assembly language program. This assembly code is a low-level representation of the program, which is then further converted into machine language—a binary format consisting of 1s and 0s—that can be directly executed by the hardware.

Additionally, an essential interface between the RISC-V architecture and the hardware layout is the use of Hardware Description Languages (HDLs), such as Verilog. HDLs are used to design and simulate the hardware structure, ensuring the binary instructions generated are compatible and can be correctly implemented on the hardware.

This process bridges the gap between software code and physical hardware implementation, enabling seamless execution of programs on custom hardware designs.
